           "You can turn this on by using the command `fbot on` (it's case insensitive) in the desired channel and FBot will begin __replying__ to your messages. If only want admins to be able to toggle FBot, you can use `fbot modtoggle on`",

           ":thinking: **How can I set up a counting channel with FBot?**",
           "In the desired channel, use `fbot set` and simply start counting! The rules are simple: send the next number, and don't send two numbers in a row. You can check your highscore, the current number and more with `fbot counting`",

           "If you want FBot to respond to less messages you can use `fbot respond few`, by default fbot respond is set to `all`, but you can change it to few, some or all, depending on what suits your server",

           "So. Fricken. Many. Image comamnds like `fbot god`, say commands like `fbot biblical`; where you can provide text or reply to a message, same goes for `fbot respects` which is used to pay respects, we've got minigames like `fbot snake`. And so, so much more!",

           ":sleeping: **Sounds great! There can't be anything else, can there?**",
           "Well yes, there is but you'll have to find it out for yourself, with `fbot help` & `fbot cmds`, which will give you a list of commands! And if you find a bug, have a suggestion or just wanna chat, use `fbot server` to enter ~~hell~~ our server!"]

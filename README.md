# **FBot**
##### *The most annoying bot on discord*

## Features
- **Lots of fun stuff**
 	- ***Message responses***, sort of our main feature, no big deal. FBot can respond to a wide range of messages, this is also referred to as it's the spam feature, and can be used to encourage users to spam in specific channels while also giving everyone a bit of fun
 	- ***Counting*** (yay?). Yes we said it, counting. This allows your members to practise their first grade counting skills and compete against other servers on our global leaderboard
 	- ***Image processing*** commands to bonk yourself, bigpp your friends and trigger your enemies with more added regularly (sort of)
 	- ***Say commands***, which let you, get this, say things. But as FBot
 	- ***Minigames!!!*** FBot currently has two minigames built into the DUI (discord user interface?) with more planned, and we'd love to hear what you would like to see!
- **Highly Customisable**
  - The S.P.A.M.S (**S**ophisticated **P**ersonalised **A**utomated **M**essaging **S**ystem) feature is set to off by default but can be toggled on individually in a channel when necessary (which is always, obviously)
  - ***Modes*** (the speak feature) changes how FBot talks, experience the uwu mode which does exactly what you wouldn't want it to do, pirate talk (arr), f^^k mode which appropriately adds said word into a sentence as many times as is grammatically possible, and much more!
  - ***Responds feature***, allows for less spam and use in more channels, by only responding to less common messages
  - As always ***customisable prefixes***, but we don't think you'll need it (fbot is the best prefix)
- **And more**
 	- FBot has a powerful snipe command (can retrieve up to 10 messages in a channel and hides messages deleted after say and purge)
 	- Lots of useful help, information and link commands
 	- Meta commands for version, uptime and usage stats to name a few

Who would we be if we didn't say that we have 24/7 uptime (or 99.77% according to [discord.bots.gg](https://discord.bots.gg/bots/711934102906994699))
You should also find comfort in knowing that you can share your annoyance of FBot with your members, even if you don't always see eye to eye

## **Reviews**
Don't just take our word for it, what do our users say?
 > *"Oh... this bot is just spam"*

 > *"How do you turn this thing off?"*

 > *"8 minutes of my life I can never get back"*

 > *"Why is this thing a thing?"*
